# 📦 Replication Package: Not All Tokens Matter: Data-Centric Optimization for Efficient Code Summarization

This repository contains the complete replication package for the ```Data-Centric Optimization in Code Summarization Dataset``` paper:


---

## 📚 Overview

Our study explores **data-centric optimization strategies** for improving efficiency and reliability in training large language models (LLMs) for code summarization. We investigate three **token-level reduction techniques**—Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Function Signature (FS), and CrystalBLEU (CBLUE) guided filtering—combined with **semantic filtering via the SIDE metric**. Experiments span Java and Python, including a newly retrained semantic alignment metric for Python (SIDE-py).

This replication package includes:

- Token-based optimization (Study-1)
- Training and validation of SIDE-py (Study-2)
- Cross-language replication (Study-3)
